- **INTRODUCTION :**
    
    Even though the UI looks unpleasant, don't worry about it, you don't need technical skills here, everything is running automatically.
    What you prepare are the novel links that this LnCrawler supports and the ability of your fingers to press the buttons.
    Daily life for you... ✌
    
    **WARNING:**
    
    If that Novel link doesn't work anymore, please look elsewhere.
    Don't bother with the darn PMs/DMs. 👿
    I definitely won't open them.
    
    **NOTE :**
    
    [https://www.wuxiaworld.com/](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/)  users pls use an older version 2.29.4. But ~~Try the latest version first~~《Not Works now》, if it doesn't work then use an older version.
    
    This method can't search for Novel titles, so we can only process novel links until we have time to create new scripts that supports search by Novel names.
    
    *Also, At this time we only process `.ePub`, `Web`, and `Text` formats until further updates.*
    
       `Only support Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Yandex, Kiwi, Edge, or Dolphin.`

    When the mirror link is having problems, you can also directly download the files through  Virtual Storage  by accessing the left panel『 ≡ 』, selecting "Show File Browser" (for Mobile devices), or clicking on icon『 📂 』(for Desktop), finding your files in a folder called random numbers.
    Then click the  three vertical dots/ellipsis 『 ⋮ 』 and Download it. (Or press and  hold  the file on Mobile devices). (Or  right-click  on Desktop).

    Temporary mirror links are pasted in these templates:
    
    (I don't recommend you download via mirror links, it's better to download directly via Virtual Storage).
    
    **Just choose the one that best suits your area:**
    
    1). [Anonfiles.com](http://anonfiles.com/)  (be careful there are ads in the 1st or maybe 2nd opening, just ignore files containing apk, accept just epub/zip files only).
    
    2). [Temp.sh](http://temp.sh/)  (most useful currently). Temporary DOWN!!!
    
    3). [Transfer.sh](http://transfer.sh/)  (The veteran, best choice).== Newest addition.
